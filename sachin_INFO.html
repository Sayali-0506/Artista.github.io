        Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar  is a
        former international cricketer of India who served as captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded
        as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[6] He is the highest run scorer of all time in
        international cricket, and the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman
        to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both
        Test and ODI cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[7] In

        of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[8][9][10] He is affectionately known as "Little Master" or "Master Blaster"
