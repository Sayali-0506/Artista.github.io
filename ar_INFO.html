        Allah Rakha Rahman[1] (About this soundpronunciation (help·info); born A. S. Dileep Kumar; 6 January 1967) is an
        Indian film composer, record producer, singer and songwriter who works predominantly in Tamil and Hindi films.
        In 2010, the Indian government awarded him the Padma Bhushan, the nation's third-highest civilian award.[2]
        Among Rahman's awards are six National Film Awards, two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a
        Golden Globe Award, fifteen Filmfare Awards and seventeen Filmfare Awards South.

        Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian
        television channels. With his in-house studio Panchathan Record Inn, Rahman's film-scoring career began during
        the early 1990s with the Tamil film Roja.[3] Following that, he went on to score several songs for Tamil
        language films, including Ratnam's politically charged Bombay, the urban Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda, and S.
        Shankar's debut film Gentleman. Rahman's score for his first Hollywood film, the comedy Couples Retreat (2009),
        won the BMI Award for Best Score. His music for Slumdog Millionaire (2008) earned him Best Original Score and
        Best Original Song at the 81st Academy Awards. He was also awarded Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best
        Song Written for Visual Media at the 2010 Grammy Awards. He is nicknamed "Isai Puyal" (musical storm) and
        "Mozart of Madras"
